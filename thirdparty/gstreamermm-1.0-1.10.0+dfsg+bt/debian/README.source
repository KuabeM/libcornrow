gstreamermm source for Debian
--------------------------
	
The gstreamermm source is repackaged because it ships a version of it's
documentation that is not reproducible from source.
When running uscan the script debian/get-orig-source.sh is executed, which

- unpacks the source tarball
- removes docs/reference/[gstreamermm-1.0.devhelp2, gstreamermm-1.0.tag, html/]
- builds the .orig.tar.xz Debian source tarball

The script is fully compliant with uscan and its switches like --destdir.
If the opposite is discovered, this should be reported as a bug.
